During the job search, many students struggle to secure interview invitations. Tailoring our resumes to align closely with specific job descriptions can significantly increase our chances of being noticed, but fine-tuning our resumes to achieve the highest match percentage can be exceedingly time-consuming. Imagine having a system that extracts key words from the job description, calculates the match percentage, and provides feedback on your resume. With such a tool, you could easily update your resume to meet specific criteria, saving a considerable amount of time.

This is precisely the goal I aimed to achieve with this project. My friends and I were facing difficulties in receiving interview calls. By utilizing this system, they have been able to swiftly tailor their resumes and secure interviews. I leveraged Google's Gemini model to generate responses and integrated this model into a Streamlit app to facilitate ease of use. This app is accessible even to those outside the tech field, making it a versatile tool for job seekers. Special thanks to Streamlit for enabling this accessibility.
