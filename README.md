As a student, during the job search, all of have a hard time to get interview calls. We need to tailor our resume as per the given job description to get the highest possible match percentage.
The process of finetuning/tailoring the resume can be too time consuming. What if, you have a system that will extract the key words from the job description, return the match percentage and
provide a review of your resume. Then, you can easily update your resume as per the needs and save lots of time.

This is what I've tried to create with the help of this project. Me and my friends are having a hard time getting interview calls. Using this system, my friends have benefitted in tailoring
their resume quickly and get interview calls. I've used Google's Gemini model to generate the response and integrated the model into a StreamLit app for easy operation. Those who are not
in tech field can also have an access using this app. Again, thanks to SteamLit.
